# Flight Per KM Cost

This project calculates the per kilometer (km) cost of a flight. It is designed to help airlines, aviation analysts, and travelers estimate flight costs based on various parameters such as distance, fuel consumption, ticket prices, and operational costs. 

## Features

- Calculate cost per km for different flight routes
- Input custom values for distance, total cost, and other variables
- Flexible and easy-to-use interface
- Potential integration with flight data APIs

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x (if the project is a Python-based application)
- Additional requirements as specified in `requirements.txt` (if present)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Shalini-priya6299/Flight_per_km_cost.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Flight_per_km_cost
   ```
3. (For Python projects) Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Usage

1. Prepare the input data: distance traveled, total cost (fuel, crew, etc.), and other variables as required.
2. Run the main program/script to calculate the cost per km.
   For example:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
3. Enter data as prompted, or modify input files as needed.

## Example

Suppose you have the following data:
- Total flight operating cost: $50,000
- Flight distance: 2,000 km

The per km cost is:
```
$50,000 / 2,000 km = $25 per km
```
